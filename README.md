# Breakout (BO) Wide Receiver (WR) Study for 2022-2023 NFL Season

In this repo, you will find a jupyter notebook outlining the steps taken to determine a breakout WR based on this upcoming season's ADP data.

If you want to follow along: clone this repo, create a Python virtual environment, install the requirements found in `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

In the PFR_scripts folder, there are a few different scripts to scrape specific types of data off of Pro Football Reference. Please feel free to use them.
In the Other folder, there are a variety of other quick studies that I did as I learned to data munge and analyze. They are not as well documented as the purpose of this repo is for breakout WR study.
